# Terraform Mixins

A Terraform mixin (inspired by the [concept of the same name in OOP languages such as Python and Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin))
is a Terraform configuration file that can be dropped into a root-level module, i.e. a component, in order to add additional
functionality.

Mixins are meant to encourage code reuse, leading to more simple components with less code repetition between component
to component.
